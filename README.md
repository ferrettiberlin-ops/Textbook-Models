# Textbook-Models

This repository is made for me to post scripts I wrote that take concepts I learn in school at HKUST and applying them to real data. All AI generated concent is labelled within the scripts. 

# DGM Valuation 

DGM Valuation is a script that takes the Dividend Growth Model learnt in FINA2303 and uses it to create a Decision Matrix that tells you which stocks are over/under valued in real time. (Inputs R (Cost of Capital) and G (Growth rate) uses very basic calculations which scew the model)

The tickers used are notoriously known for being DGM appropriate

# Daily Tracker 

The Daily Tracker is a Macros Enabled Excel File that allows you to press various buttons to log the amount of time spent on a task while recording the days/times that you logged it without overlapping different tasks on the same day. It is based on the ISOM2010 Lab that taught us how to use VBA for Business Analytics.
